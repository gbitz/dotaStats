Finished the ground work for my repo, added THIS journal, project plan, time log, and
the design documents(wireframes and user stories)  Took a little longer than expected, but
now I have a better plan on what I need to accomplish each week to complete this project.

I did a little more research on the api I plan to use for this project and it seems like I will
be able to find all necessary information to complete my project. 
### Week 2-18-19 -> 2-24-19
I added the userDao and tests for user CRUD interaction with the database.  Took longer than expected. 
Looking to have more time to research my project
