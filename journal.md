### Week 2-11-19 -> 2-17-19
Completed 
 -Link to repo
 -project plan
 -time log
 -user stories
 -wireframes
 
Finished the ground work for my repo, added THIS journal, project plan, time log, and
the design documents(wireframes and user stories)  Took a little longer than expected, but
now I have a better plan on what I need to accomplish each week to complete this project.

I did a little more research on the api I plan to use for this project and it seems like I will
be able to find all necessary information to complete my project.
